32,2007,,,6,,"Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, currently of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and Hannover Medical School in Germany, took the next step. They had independently been teasing out the roles of various CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria deploy the DNA spacers in their immune defenses. But the duo soon joined forces to focus on a CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9, as it was sim- pler than other CRISPR systems.

When CRISPR goes into action in response to an invading phage, bacteria transcribe the spacers and the palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule that the cell then cuts into short spacer-derived RNAs called crRNAs. An additional stretch of RNA, called tracrRNA, works with Cas9 to produce the crRNA, Charpentier’s group reported in Nature in 2011. The group pro- posed that together, Cas9, tracrRNA, and crRNA somehow attack foreign DNA that matches the crRNA.

The two teams found that the Cas9 pro- tein is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA, with two active cutting sites, one site for each strand of the DNA’s double helix. And in a discovery that foreshadowed CRISPR’s broad potential for genome engi- neering, the team demonstrated that they could disable one or both cutting sites with- out interfering with the ability of the complex to home in on its target DNA. “The possibility of using a single enzyme by just changing the RNA seemed very simple,” Doudna recalls.",paper,Scientific ,,United States ,,,timeline structure,

At the same time, several clusters of signature CRISPR-associated (cas) genes were identified to be well conserved and typically adjacent to the repeat elements (Jansen et al., 2002), serving as a basis for the eventual classification of three different types of CRISPR systems (types I–III) (Haft et al., 2005; Makarova et al., 2011b).",,,Jansen; Mojica; Barrangou; van der Oost; Haft; Makarova ,,,,narrative structure,
211,2005,,,2,,"A key turning point came in 2005, when systematic analysis of the spacer sequences separating the individual direct repeats suggested their extrachromosomal and phage-associated origins (Mojica et al., 2005; Pourcel et al., 2005; Bolotin et al., 2005). This insight was tremendously exciting, especially given previous studies showing that CRISPR loci are transcribed (Tang et al., 2002) and that viruses are unable to infect archaeal cells carrying spacers corresponding to their own genomes (Mojica et al., 2005). Together, these findings led to the speculation that CRISPR arrays serve as an immune memory and defense mechanism, and individual spacers facilitate defense against bacteriophage infection by exploiting Watson-Crick base-pairing between nucleic acids (Mojica et al., 2005; Pourcel et al., 2005). Despite these compelling realizations that CRISPR loci might be involved in microbial immunity, the specific mechanism of how the spacers act to mediate viral defense remained a challenging puzzle.",,,Mojica; Pourcel; Bolotin; Tang,,,,narrative structure,

In the same year, CRISPR-mediated defense by a type III-A CRISPR system from Staphylococcus epidermidis was demonstrated to block plasmid conjugation, establishing the target of Cas enzyme activity as DNA rather than RNA (Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008), although later investigation of a different type III-B system from Pyrococcus furiosus also revealed crRNA-directed RNA cleavage activity (Hale et al., 2009, 2012).",,,Marraffini; Sontheimer; Brouns; Hale; van der Oost,,,,narrative structure,

Additionally, for types I and II, the lack of PAM within the direct repeat sequence within the CRISPR array prevents self-targeting by the CRISPR system. In type III systems, however, mismatches between the 50 end of the crRNA and the DNA target are required for plasmid interference (Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010).",,,Deveau; Marraffini; Sontheimer; Bolotin; Moineau,,,,narrative structure,

217,2010-2011,,,2,,"Around this time, two studies characterizing the functional mechanisms of the native type II CRISPR system elucidated the basic components that proved vital for engineering a simple RNA-programmable DNA endonuclease for genome editing. First, Moineau and colleagues used genetic studies in Streptococcus thermophilus to reveal that Cas9 (formerly called Cas5, Csn1, or Csx12) is the only enzyme within the cas gene cluster that mediates target DNA cleavage (Garneau et al., 2010). Next, Charpentier and colleagues revealed a key component in the biogenesis and processing of crRNA in type II CRISPR systems—a noncoding trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) that hybridizes with crRNA to facilitate RNA-guided targeting of Cas9 (Deltcheva et al., 2011). This dual RNA hybrid, together with Cas9 and endogenous RNase III, is required for processing the CRISPR array transcript into mature crRNAs (Deltcheva et al., 2011). These two studies suggested that there are at least three components (Cas9, the mature crRNA, and tracrRNA) that are essential for reconstituting the type II CRISPR nuclease system. Given the increasing importance of programmable site-specific nucleases based on ZFs and TALEs for enhancing eukaryotic genome editing, it was tantalizing to think that perhaps Cas9 could be developed into an RNA-guided genome editing system.

A single microbe could have several such stretches, each with different repeat and intervening sequences. This pattern appears in more than 40% of bacteria and fully 90% of microbes in a different domain, the archaea, and gives CRISPR its name.

250,2011,,,1,,"Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, currently of the Helmholtz Centre for Infec- tion Research and Hannover Medical School in Germany, took the next step. They had independently been teasing out the roles of various CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria deploy the DNA spacers in their immune defenses. But the duo soon joined forces to focus on a CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9, as it was sim- pler than other CRISPR systems.

When CRISPR goes into action in response to an invading phage, bacteria transcribe the spacers and the palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule that the cell then cuts into short spacer-derived RNAs called crRNAs. An additional stretch of RNA, called tracrRNA, works with Cas9 to produce the crRNA, Charpentier’s group reported in Nature in 2011. The group pro- posed that together, Cas9, tracrRNA, and crRNA somehow attack foreign DNA that matches the crRNA.

The two teams found that the Cas9 pro- tein is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA, with two active cutting sites, one site for each strand of the DNA’s double helix. And in a discovery that foreshadowed CRISPR’s broad potential for genome engi- neering, the team demonstrated that they could disable one or both cutting sites with- out interfering with the ability of the com- plex to home in on its target DNA. “The possibility of using a single enzyme by just changing the RNA seemed very simple,” Doudna recalls.",,,,,,,,
251,2012,,,1,,"Before CRISPR could be put to use, however, Doudna’s and Charpentier’s teams had to show that they could control where Cas9 went to do its cutting. First, Doudna’s postdoc, Martin Jinek, figured out how to combine tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a “single-guide RNA” molecule; then, as a proof of principle, the team last year made several guide RNAs, mixed them with Cas9, and showed in a test tube that the synthetic complexes could find and cut their DNA tar- gets (Science, 17 August 2012, p. 816). “That was a milestone paper,” Barrangou says.",,,,,,,,
