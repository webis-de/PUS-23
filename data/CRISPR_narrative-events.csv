Although the CRISPR array was similar to previously reported systems, it lacked some of the known cas genes and instead contained novel cas genes, including one encoding a large protein they predicted to have nuclease activity, which is now known as Cas9. Furthermore, they noted that the spacers, which have homology to viral genes, all share a common sequence at one end. This sequence, the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), is required for target recognition.

Another group, working independently, published similar findings around this same time (Pourcel et al., 2005).",publication,,"Francisco Mojica, University of Alicante, Spain",,,mojica:2005;pourcel:2005,,timeline structure,
105,2006,3,,10,,"Hypothetical scheme of adaptive immunity: Koonin was studying clusters of orthologous groups of proteins by computational analysis and proposed a hypothetical scheme for CRISPR cascades as bacterial immune system based on inserts homologous to phage DNA in the natural spacer array, abandoning previous hypothesis that the Cas proteins might comprise a novel DNA repair system.

106,2007,3,,10,,"Experimental demonstration of adaptive immunity: S. thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry to make yogurt and cheese, and scientists at Danisco wanted to explore how it responds to phage attack, a common problem in industrial yogurt making. Horvath and colleagues showed experimentally that CRISPR systems are indeed an adaptive immune system: they integrate new phage DNA into the CRISPR array, which allows them to fight off the next wave of attacking phage (Barrangou et al., 2007). Furthermore, they showed that Cas9 is likely the only protein required for interference, the process by which the CRISPR system inactivates invading phage, details of which were not yet known.",publication,,"Philippe Horvath, Danisco France SAS",,,barrangou:2007,,timeline structure,
107,2008,8,,10,,"Spacer sequences are transcribed into guide RNAs: Scientists soon began to fill in some of the details on exactly how CRISPR-Cas systems “interfere” with invading phage. The first piece of critical information came from John van der Oost and colleagues who showed that in E-scherichia coli, spacer sequences, which are derived from phage, are transcribed into small RNAs, termed CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), that guide Cas proteins to the target DNA (Brouns et al., 2008).",publication,,"John van der Oost, University of Wageningen, Netherlands",,,brouns:2008,,timeline structure,
108,2008,12,,10,,"CRISPR acts on DNA targets: The next key piece in understanding the mechanism of interference came from Marraffini and Sontheimer, who elegantly demonstrated that the target molecule is DNA, not RNA (Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008). This was somewhat surprising, as many people had considered CRISPR to be a parallel to eukaryotic RNAi silencing mechanisms, which target RNA. Marraffini and Sontheimer explicitly noted in their paper that this system could be a powerful tool if it could be transferred to non-bacterial systems. (It should be noted, however, that a different type of CRISPR system can target RNA (Hale et al., 2009)).",publication,,"Luciano Marraffini and Erik Sontheimer, Northwestern University, Illinois",,,hale:2009,,timeline structure,
109,2010,12,,10,,"Cas9 cleaves target DNA: Moineau and colleagues demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 creates double-stranded breaks in target DNA at precise positions, 3 nucleotides upstream of the PAM (Garneau et al., 2010). They also confirmed that Cas9 is the only protein required for cleavage in the CRISPR-Cas9 system. This is a distinguishing feature of Type II CRISPR systems, in which interference is mediated by a single large protein (here Cas9) in conjunction with crRNAs.",publication,,"Sylvain Moineau, University of Laval, Quebec City, Canada",,,garneau:2010,,timeline structure,
110,2011,3,,10,,"Discovery of tracrRNA for Cas9 system: The final piece to the puzzle in the mechanism of natural CRISPR-Cas9-guided interference came from the group of Emmanuelle Charpentier. They performed small RNA sequencing on Streptococcus pyogenes, which has a Cas9-containing CRISPR-Cas system. They discovered that in addition to the crRNA, a second small RNA exists, which they called trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) (Deltcheva et al., 2011).  They showed that tracrRNA forms a duplex with crRNA, and that it is this duplex that guides Cas9 to its targets.",publication,,"Emmanuelle Charpentier, Umea University, Sweden and University of Vienna, Austria",,,deltcheva:2011,,timeline structure,
111,2011,7,,10,,"CRISPR systems can function heterologously in other species: Siksnys and colleagues cloned the entire CRISPR-Cas locus from S. thermophilus (a Type II system) and expressed it in E. coli (which does not contain a Type II system), where they demonstrated that it was capable of providing plasmid resistance (Sapranauskas et al., 2011). This suggested that CRISPR systems are self-contained units and verified that all of the required components of the Type II system were known.",publication,,"Virginijus Siksnys, Vilnius University",,,sapranauskas:2011,,timeline structure,

They also noted that the crRNA could be trimmed down to a 20-nt stretch sufficient for efficient cleavage. Most impressively, they showed that they could reprogram Cas9 to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of the crRNA.",publication,,"Virginijus Siksnys, Vilnius University",,,gasiunas:2012,,timeline structure,

Zhang and his team engineered two different Cas9 orthologs (from S. thermophilus and S. pyogenes) and demonstrated targeted genome cleavage in human and mouse cells. They also showed that the system (i) could be programmed to target multiple genomic loci, and (ii) could drive homology-directed repair.

Additionally, for types I and II, the lack of PAM within the direct repeat sequence within the CRISPR array prevents self-targeting by the CRISPR system.

Next, Charpentier and colleagues revealed a key component in the biogenesis and processing of crRNA in type II CRISPR systems—a noncoding trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) that hybridizes with crRNA to facilitate RNA-guided targeting of Cas9 (Deltcheva et al., 2011). This dual RNA hybrid, together with Cas9 and endogenous RNase III, is required for processing the CRISPR array transcript into mature crRNAs (Deltcheva et al., 2011). These two studies suggested that there are at least three components (Cas9, the mature crRNA, and tracrRNA) that are essential for reconstituting the type II CRISPR nuclease system.

A single microbe could have several such stretches, each with different repeat and intervening sequences.

250,2011,,,1,,"Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, currently of the Helmholtz Centre for Infec- tion Research and Hannover Medical School in Germany, took the next step. They had independently been teasing out the roles of various CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria deploy the DNA spacers in their immune defenses. But the duo soon joined forces to focus on a CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9, as it was sim- pler than other CRISPR systems.

When CRISPR goes into action in response to an invading phage, bacteria transcribe the spacers and the palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule that the cell then cuts into short spacer-derived RNAs called crRNAs. An additional stretch of RNA, called tracrRNA, works with Cas9 to produce the crRNA, Charpentier’s group reported in Nature in 2011. The group pro- posed that together, Cas9, tracrRNA, and crRNA somehow attack foreign DNA that matches the crRNA.

The two teams found that the Cas9 pro- tein is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA, with two active cutting sites, one site for each strand of the DNA’s double helix. And in a discovery that foreshadowed CRISPR’s broad potential for genome engi- neering, the team demonstrated that they could disable one or both cutting sites with- out interfering with the ability of the com- plex to home in on its target DNA. “The possibility of using a single enzyme by just changing the RNA seemed very simple,” Doudna recalls.",,,,,,,,,
251,2012,,,1,,"Before CRISPR could be put to use, however, Doudna’s and Charpentier’s teams had to show that they could control where Cas9 went to do its cutting. First, Doudna’s postdoc, Martin Jinek, figured out how to combine tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a “single-guide RNA” molecule; then, as a proof of principle, the team last year made several guide RNAs, mixed them with Cas9, and showed in a test tube that the synthetic complexes could find and cut their DNA tar- gets (Science, 17 August 2012, p. 816). “That was a milestone paper,” Barrangou says.",,,,,,,,,
