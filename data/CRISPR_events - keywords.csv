27,2005,5,,Russian scientist Alexander Bolotin, working at Institut national de la recherche agronomique, discovers an unusual CRISPR locus while studying the bacteria streptococcus thermophilus. Although similar to previously reported systems, the CRISPR array discovered would lack some of the known cas genes and instead contained novel cas genes, including one encoding a large protein they predicted to have nuclease activity, which is now known as Cas9. Bolotin's team would also note that the spacers, which have homology to viral genes, all share a common sequence at one end. This sequence would be later known as protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).[8][3] ,paper,Scientific ,,France ,bolotin:2005,https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_CRISPR,Bolotin;Institut national de la recherche agronomique;streptococcus thermophilus;cas( genes)*;Cas9;protospacer adjacent motif;PAM
