Since then, the method has taken the scientific communityby storm, with thousands of labs using it for applications from biomedicine to agriculture. Yet, thepreceding 20-year journey—the discovery of a strange microbial repeat sequence; its recognitionas an adaptive immune system; its biological characterization; and its repurposing for genome en-gineering—remains little known. This Perspective aims to fill in this backstory—the history of ideasand the stories of pioneers—and draw lessons about the remarkable ecosystem underlying scien-tific discovery.",,Cell/Lander is founder of the Broad Institute,

In contrast with the previous historical descrip- tion, these three articles did not simply demonstrate the bacteriophage origin of some of the spacer sequences, but they collectively reached the conclusion that the CRISPR- Cas system was a memory of infection and a defence system against further infections. They provided information on the mechanism of insertion of the new spacers, and proposed hypotheses on the way these spacers prevented further in- fection. Therefore, the issue is what the 2006 and 2007 publications really provided and why the 2005 contributions were not better recognized?",,Morange,controversy!
