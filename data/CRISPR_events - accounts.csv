In contrast with the previous historical descrip- tion, these three articles did not simply demonstrate the bacteriophage origin of some of the spacer sequences, but they collectively reached the conclusion that the CRISPR- Cas system was a memory of infection and a defence system against further infections. They provided information on the mechanism of insertion of the new spacers, and proposed hypotheses on the way these spacers prevented further in- fection. Therefore, the issue is what the 2006 and 2007 publications really provided and why the 2005 contributions were not better recognized?",,Morange,controversy!,
