Since then, the method has taken the scientific communityby storm, with thousands of labs using it for applications from biomedicine to agriculture. Yet, thepreceding 20-year journey—the discovery of a strange microbial repeat sequence; its recognitionas an adaptive immune system; its biological characterization; and its repurposing for genome en-gineering—remains little known. This Perspective aims to fill in this backstory—the history of ideasand the stories of pioneers—and draw lessons about the remarkable ecosystem underlying scien-tific discovery.",,Cell/Lander is founder of the Broad Institute

 understanding what biotechnology is, its origins and the major role it 
plays in healthcare. Drawing on a collection of sources from scientists

 approval and regulation, the website aims to provide a unique insight 
into the many complexities involved in the development and application 
of biotechnology. Such material is considered alongside the risks and 
benefits posed by biotechnology and the personal stories of those whose 
lives have been affected by it.
        
Intended to be a dynamic and growing educational resource, WiB 
welcomes all comments and suggestions about any people, places and 
sciences not already covered on the site. We are keen to have any 
information relating to those whose experiences are often missed in 
traditional accounts of the science and industry behind biotechnology, 
including women and those based in developing countries.",,"WhatIsBiotechnology.org (WiB) is an independent, non-profit educational organisation.
