In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering an entire custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which was the first clue that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","A number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity. \n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli it has been shown that Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I, type II but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence also appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[5][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (eg. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in it's daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (eg http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: âIf you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture by 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys,[31] nonviable human embryos[32] and other organisms.\n","\n","Additionally CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering an entire custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which was the first clue that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","A number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli it has been shown that Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I, type II but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence also appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[5][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture by 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys,[31] nonviable human embryos[32] and other organisms.\n","\n","Additionally CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering an entire custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which was the first clue that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","A number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli it has been shown that Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I, type II but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence also appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[5][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture by 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys,[31] nonviable human embryos[32] and other organisms.\n","\n","Additionally CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering an entire custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which was the first clue that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","A number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli it has been shown that Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I, type II but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence also appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[5][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture by 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys,[31] nonviable human embryos[32] and other organisms.\n","\n","Additionally CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering an entire custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which was the first clue that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","A number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli it has been shown that Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I, type II but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence also appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","CRISPR-associated (cas) genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which was the first clue that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","A number of Cas1 proteins have been biochemically characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have very diverse amino acid sequences, however their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have also been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli it has been shown that Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I, type II but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence also appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicated that they were involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli have demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","A number of CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires both the Cas proteins involved in acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. Type III systems also use Cas6, however the repeats found in type III systems do not produce stem-loops, instead cleavage occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. A number of phage and plasmid challenge experiments have shown that crRNAs show no preference between coding and non-coding strand, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus have both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore inferred to be common to all three systems. Even through the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage of the chromosome.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88] \n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","Studies of Streptococcus thermophilus first showed how CRISPRs drive phage and bacterial evolution. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts where there are point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91] The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied using comparative genomics of many strains of S. thermophilus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] The results showed that particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A similar analysis of E. coli and S. enterica strains revealed that they evolved much slower than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","CRISPR diversity was studied in multiple environmental communities using metagenomics. Analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared between timepoints over 17 months within an individual and less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals at any timepoint.[72] From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution between timepoints.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to the outcome of CRISPR and phage evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where there are many reference genomes available, PCR can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach will only yield information for CRISPRs specifically targeted and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative approach is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. Identification of CRISPR arrays from metagenomic reads is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units being present in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes; the scientists who conducted the research noted that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine, and said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%....

A clear distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of gene editing are limited to the individual, versus germline cells, where changes in the genome will be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each specific application as this is the sequence that Cas9 will use to directly bind to the cell's DNA. It needs to bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the hanging ends and codes for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","One or more crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR Cas9 depends primarily on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long and found as a part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] Typically a crRNA array will have multiple unique CRISPR target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the CRISPR target sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The CRISPR target sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] On the other hand, the PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not overly limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the cell's genome. Once incorporated into the cell's genome this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and will be found in its daughter cells.\n","\n","There are many online tools available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences (e.g. http://tools.genome-engineering.org) when designing a new CRISPR Cas9 plasmid.\n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[116]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[117][118]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering.

The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[121] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes.

This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene x environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] \n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome that is found roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs.[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116] \n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","\"CRISPRi\" like RNAi, turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and producing fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] \n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116] \n","\n","CRISPRs can add and delete base pairs at specifically targeted DNA loci[10] and have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117]CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in the following applications:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","\"CRISPRi\" like RNAi, turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigentically modified. This modification inhibits transcription of the gene. RNA-guided CRISPR associated nuclease Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription, but for mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and producing fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were still developing.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] \n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116] \n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] \n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116] \n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] \n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116] \n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition. \n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference. \n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence. \n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82] \n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72] \n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent aÂ consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115] \n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116] \n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[126]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[127]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[128] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[133]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[126]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[127]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[128] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[133]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","\t\t\t\t\t\tCRISPR-DR2: Secondary structure taken from the Rfam database.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9.

The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA.

Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision. Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components.[40][41] The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Mechanism\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","When a microbe is invaded by a virus, the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[126]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[127]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[128] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][129] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[130]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[131][132] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[133] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[133]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[134]\n","\n","In 2012 and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year award.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays.

Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","In 2003 evolutionary biologist Austin Burt envisioned attaching a gene that coded for a desired trait to âselfishâ DNA elements that could copy themselves from one chromosome spot to another. That would bias daughter cells to inherit it, quickly spreading it throughout a population. In 2015 a U.S. team used CRISPR to create a âmutagenic chain reaction,â that drove a pigmentation trait in lab-grown Drosophila to the next generation with 97% efficiency. With another research group they created a gene drive in mosquitoes that spread genes that prevented the insects from harboring malaria parasites. Only weeks later, the team reported the a second drive with genes that rendered female mosquitoes infertile and could quickly wipe out a population. The work was done in the lab, leading to debates over the desirability of field testing.[126]\n","\n","Using âdeadâ versions of Cas9, eliminates CRISPRâs DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dead Cas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or subtly adjust its level of activity. [126]\n","\n","In another 2015 experiment the 20,000 or so known human genes were separately targeted turning them on one by one in groups of cells to identify those involved in resistance to a melanoma drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate \"drug\", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.[126]\n","\n","Clinical researchers are applying it to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.[126]\n","\n","CRISPR may revive the concept of transplanting animal organs into people. Retroviruses present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015 a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirusâs DNA from the pig genome.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","In 2012 and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year award.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision.

Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","In 2003 evolutionary biologist Austin Burt envisioned attaching a gene that coded for a desired trait to âselfishâ DNA elements that could copy themselves from one chromosome spot to another. That would bias daughter cells to inherit it, quickly spreading it throughout a population. In 2015 a U.S. team used CRISPR to create a âmutagenic chain reaction,â that drove a pigmentation trait in lab-grown Drosophila to the next generation with 97% efficiency. With another research group they created a gene drive in mosquitoes that spread genes that prevented the insects from harboring malaria parasites. Only weeks later, the team reported the a second drive with genes that rendered female mosquitoes infertile and could quickly wipe out a population. The work was done in the lab, leading to debates over the desirability of field testing.[126]\n","\n","Using âdeadâ versions of Cas9, eliminates CRISPRâs DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dead Cas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or subtly adjust its level of activity. [126]\n","\n","In another 2015 experiment the 20,000 or so known human genes were separately targeted turning them on one by one in groups of cells to identify those involved in resistance to a melanoma drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate \"drug\", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.[126]\n","\n","Clinical researchers are applying it to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.[126]\n","\n","CRISPR may revive the concept of transplanting animal organs into people. Retroviruses present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015 a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirusâs DNA from the pig genome.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","In 2012 and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year award.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision.

Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","In 2003 evolutionary biologist Austin Burt envisioned attaching a gene that coded for a desired trait to âselfishâ DNA elements that could copy themselves from one chromosome spot to another. That would bias daughter cells to inherit it, quickly spreading it throughout a population. In 2015 a U.S. team used CRISPR to create a âmutagenic chain reaction,â that drove a pigmentation trait in lab-grown Drosophila to the next generation with 97% efficiency. With another research group they created a gene drive in mosquitoes that spread genes that prevented the insects from harboring malaria parasites. Only weeks later, the team reported the a second drive with genes that rendered female mosquitoes infertile and could quickly wipe out a population. The work was done in the lab, leading to debates over the desirability of field testing.[126]\n","\n","Using âdeadâ versions of Cas9, eliminates CRISPRâs DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dead Cas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or subtly adjust its level of activity. [126]\n","\n","In another 2015 experiment the 20,000 or so known human genes were separately targeted turning them on one by one in groups of cells to identify those involved in resistance to a melanoma drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate \"drug\", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.[126]\n","\n","Clinical researchers are applying it to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.[126]\n","\n","CRISPR may revive the concept of transplanting animal organs into people. Retroviruses present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015 a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirusâs DNA from the pig genome.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","In 2012 and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year award.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision.

Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","In 2003 evolutionary biologist Austin Burt envisioned attaching a gene that coded for a desired trait to âselfishâ DNA elements that could copy themselves from one chromosome spot to another. That would bias daughter cells to inherit it, quickly spreading it throughout a population. In 2015 a U.S. team used CRISPR to create a âmutagenic chain reaction,â that drove a pigmentation trait in lab-grown Drosophila to the next generation with 97% efficiency. With another research group they created a gene drive in mosquitoes that spread genes that prevented the insects from harboring malaria parasites. Only weeks later, the team reported the a second drive with genes that rendered female mosquitoes infertile and could quickly wipe out a population. The work was done in the lab, leading to debates over the desirability of field testing.[126]\n","\n","Using âdeadâ versions of Cas9, eliminates CRISPRâs DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dead Cas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or subtly adjust its level of activity.[126]\n","\n","In another 2015 experiment the 20,000 or so known human genes were separately targeted turning them on one by one in groups of cells to identify those involved in resistance to a melanoma drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate \"drug\", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.[126]\n","\n","Clinical researchers are applying it to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.[126]\n","\n","CRISPR may revive the concept of transplanting animal organs into people. Retroviruses present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015 a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirusâs DNA from the pig genome.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","In 2012 and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year award.

The cas genes encode putative nuclease or helicase proteins, which are enzymes that can cut or unwind DNA.[15]\n","\n","In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[16][17][18] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that have previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[1][19] Koonin and colleagues proposed that spacers serve as a template for RNA molecules, analogous to a system called RNA interference used by eukaryotic cells.[20]\n","\n","In 2007, Barrangou, Horvath (food industry scientists at Danisco) and Moineau's group at UniversitÃ© Laval (Canada) showed that they could use spacer DNA to alter the resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage attack.[20]\n","\n","Doudna and Charpentier had independently been exploring CRISPR-associated proteins to learn how bacteria use spacers in their immune defenses.[21] They jointly studied a simpler CRISPR system that relies on a protein called Cas9. They found that bacteria respond to an invading phage by transcribing spacers and palindromic DNA into a long RNA molecule. The cell then uses tracrRNA and Cas9 to cut this long RNA molecule into pieces called crRNAs.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 is a nuclease, an enzyme specialized for cutting DNA. It has two active cutting sites (HNH and RuvC), one for each strand of the DNA's double helix. The team demonstrated that they could disable one or both sites while preserving Cas9's ability to home in on its target DNA. Jinek combined tracrRNA and spacer RNA into a \"single-guide RNA\" molecule that, mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the correct DNA targets. Jinek et al proposed that such synthetic guide RNAs could be used for gene editing.[22]\n","\n","CRISPR was first shown to work as a genome engineering/editing tool in human cell culture in 2012.[22][23] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms including baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae),[24] zebrafish (D. rerio),[25] flies (D. melanogaster),[26] axolotl (A. mexicanum),[27] nematodes (C. elegans),[28] plants,[29] mice,[30] monkeys and[31] human embryos.[32]\n","\n","CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[33]\n","\n","Libraries of tens of thousands of guide RNAs are available.[20]\n","\n","In the early 2000s, researchers developed zinc finger nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific spots. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called TALENs provided an easier way to target a double-strand break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs require researchers to make a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because they make a short RNA sequence that is paired to the targeted DNA sequence, rather than engineering a custom protein.[34]\n","\n","\n","\n","Locus structure\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","CRISPR repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs.[35] They usually show some dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a hairpin, but are not truly palindromic.[36] Repeats are separated by spacers of similar length.[35] Some CRISPR spacer sequences exactly match sequences from plasmids and phages,[16][17][18] although some spacers match the prokaryote's genome (self-targeting spacers).[16][37] New spacers can be added rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection.[38]\n","\n","Cas genes are often associated with CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Comparative genomics identified multiple cas genes; an initial analysis of 200 bacterial and archaeal genomes suggested as many as 45 cas gene families. Only cas1 and cas2 genes are present in all 45 families.[35] The current CRISPR classification groups cas operons into three major divisions, each with multiple subdivisions based on cas1 phylogeny and cas operon gene complement.[39] Aside from cas1 and cas2, each major division's operons have a common set of constituent genes. Each subdivision is characterised by a âsignature geneâ found exclusively in that subdivision.

Cas1 and Cas2 are found in all three types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of cas1 or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.[43][49][50][51][52]\n","\n","Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved.[53][54][55] Cas1 proteins have diverse amino acid sequences. However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner.[40] Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either ssRNA-[56] or dsDNA-[57][58] specific endoribonuclease activity.\n","\n","In the I-E system of E. coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers.[59] In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role,[59] binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays.[60][61][62]\n","\n","Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3 â 5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems from the three major divisions showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition.[18][63][64][65][66][67] In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array.[68][69] The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.[67][70]\n","\n","New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner,[16] occurring preferentially,[38][63][64][71][72] but not exclusively, adjacent[66][69] to the leader sequence. Analysis of the type I-E system from E. coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat, adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.[51][68]\n","\n","The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nucleotide of the protospacer). This nucleotide becomes the final base in the first direct repeat.[52][73][74] This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs characterised in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.[70] It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.\n","\n","Recent analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.[69]\n","\n","Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was elucidated in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This âprimingâ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the spacer that caused the priming.[52][73][74] This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.[74]\n","\n","The CRISPR immune response occurs through two steps: CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) biogenesis and crRNA-guided interference.\n","\n","A CRISPR array is transcribed from a promoter in the leader into a single long transcript.[43][75][76] This transcript is processed by cleavage inside the repeat sequence to form crRNAs. The mechanisms to produce mature crRNAs differ greatly between the three main CRISPR-Cas systems. In both type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops[77][78][79] created by the palindromic nature of the direct repeats.[36] These proteins cleave the primary transcript at the junction between double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, leaving an 8 nt 5Ê¹-handle[clarification needed] originating from the repeat on mature crRNAs along with a single spacer sequence.\n","\n","Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops. Cleavage instead occurs by the primary transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage 8 nt upstream of the repeat spacer junction.[80][81][82]\n","\n","Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA).[49] Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer but instead is truncated at one end by 10 nt.[46]\n","\n","CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.[4][43][52][83][84][85][86] The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins arranged in a âseahorseâ conformation, bound to a single crRNA that runs down the spine.[87][88]\n","\n","During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.\n","\n","Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step.[46] Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is also required in type II systems, however the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).\n","\n","Type III systems, like type I require a multi-protein complex to associate with the crRNA. Biochemical and structural analyses of complexes from S. solfataricus and Pyrococcus furiosus have elucidated that six or seven cas proteins bind to crRNAs, respectively.[89][90] Surprisingly, the type III systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phage/plasmids,[41][90] which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.[40]\n","\n","The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.[91] RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolution and diversity\n","********************************************************************************\n","The basic model of CRISPR evolution is one where newly incorporated spacers drive phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacteria immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.[91] Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain will remain phage sensitive.[64][91]\n","\n","A study of 124 S. thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of new spacer acquisition.[63] Particular CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A comparative genomic analysis showed that E. coli and S. enterica evolve much more slowly than S. thermophilus. The latter's strains that had diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.[92]\n","\n","Metagenomic analysis of two acid mine drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions in comparison to the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community compared to the other.[38] In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% of spacers were shared between individuals.[72]\n","\n","From the same environment a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system. Unlike the broad-level results of spacer presence/absence, which showed significant diversity, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,[72] suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly. CRISPRs have also been analysed from the metagenomes produced for the human microbiome project.[93] Although most CRISPRs were body-site specific, some CRISPRs within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these CRISPR loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some of the CRISPRs showed little evolution over time.[93]\n","\n","CRISPR evolution has been studied in chemostats using S. thermophilus to explicitly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, S. thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.[94] During the same interval the phage developed single nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that CRISPR targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.[94] Other S. thermophilus experiments showed that phages can still infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer and that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.[95] The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.\n","\n","\n","\n","Identification\n","********************************************************************************\n","CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea[39] and show some sequence similarities.[36] However their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeat copies decreases the likelihood of a false positive match. Three programs are used for CRISPR repeat identification that search for regularly interspaced repeats in long sequences: CRT,[96] PILER-CR[97] and CRISPRfinder.[98]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.[63][72][99][100][101] However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable PCR primers.\n","\n","The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely denovo identification[102] or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)[93] and direct repeat sequences from published genomes[103] as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.\n","\n","\n","\n","Evolutionary significance\n","********************************************************************************\n","A bioinformatic study showed that CRISPRs are evolutionarily conserved and cluster into related types. Many show signs of a conserved secondary structure.[36]\n","\n","Through the CRISPR/Cas mechanism, bacteria can acquire immunity to certain phages and thus halt further transmission of targeted phages. For this reason, Eugene Koonin has described CRISPR/Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism.[104] However, this has been disputed by a recent critic noting \"We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.[105]\n","\n","Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.[106] Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.[107]\n","\n","\n","\n","Use by phages\n","********************************************************************************\n","Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.[108] The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.[109]\n","\n","\n","\n","Applications\n","********************************************************************************\n","By the end of 2014 some 600 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.[110] The technology has been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and cells, to study Candida albicans, to modify yeasts used to make biofuels and to genetically modify crop strains.[110]\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a Type II CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes Cas9, CRISPR RNA (crRNA), trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a plasmid to transfect the target cells. The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template must also be designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.\n","\n","Multiple crRNA's and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells (see image for overview).\n","\n","CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used system for genome editing due to its high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. CRISPR/Cas9 depends on two factors for its specificity â the CRISPR target sequence and the PAM. The CRISPR target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[113] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence for base pair bonding with the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[114][115]\n","\n","The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by the protein structure of Cas9 and generally cannot be easily modified to recognize a difference sequence. However this is not limiting as it is a short sequence and not very specific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[113]\n","\n","Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and â depending on the Cas9 variant â creates a single or double strand break in the DNA. Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error prone than non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a section of DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.[113] The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.\n","\n","Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.[116]\n","\n","CRISPRs have been used to cut as many as five genes at once.[20] Or up to 62 genes at onceâpig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus in the pig genome, which eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.[117] CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.[8][9]\n","\n","Selective engineered redirection of the CRISPR/Cas system was first demonstrated in 2012 in:[118][119]\n","\n","Immunization of industrially important bacteria, including some used in food production and large-scale fermentation\n","\n","Cellular or organism RNA-guided genome engineering. Proof of concept studies demonstrated examples both in vitro[10][22][46] and in vivo[30][120][121]\n","\n","Bacterial strain discrimination by comparison of spacer sequences\n","\n","Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated so the gene is epigenetically modified. This modification inhibits transcription. Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.[122] In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA, called promoters that immediately precede the gene target.[20]\n","\n","Cas9 was used to carry synthetic transcription factors (protein fragments that turn on genes) that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different spots on the gene's promoter.[20]\n","\n","Some of the affected genes tied to human diseases, including those involved in muscle differentiation, cancer, inflammation and fetal hemoglobin.[20]\n","\n","CRISPR simplifies creation of animals for research that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is knocked down or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the germline level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be locally targeted.[123][124][125]\n","\n","In 2003 evolutionary biologist Austin Burt envisioned attaching a gene that coded for a desired trait to âselfishâ DNA elements that could copy themselves from one chromosome spot to another. That would bias daughter cells to inherit it, quickly spreading it throughout a population. In 2015 a U.S. team used CRISPR to create a âmutagenic chain reaction,â that drove a pigmentation trait in lab-grown Drosophila to the next generation with 97% efficiency. With another research group they created a gene drive in mosquitoes that spread genes that prevented the insects from harboring malaria parasites. Only weeks later, the team reported the a second drive with genes that rendered female mosquitoes infertile and could quickly wipe out a population. The work was done in the lab, leading to debates over the desirability of field testing.[126]\n","\n","Using âdeadâ versions of Cas9, eliminates CRISPRâs DNA-cutting ability, while preserving its ability to target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dead Cas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or subtly adjust its level of activity.[126]\n","\n","In another 2015 experiment the 20,000 or so known human genes were separately targeted turning them on one by one in groups of cells to identify those involved in resistance to a melanoma drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate \"drug\", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.[126]\n","\n","Clinical researchers are applying it to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.[126]\n","\n","CRISPR may revive the concept of transplanting animal organs into people. Retroviruses present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015 a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirusâs DNA from the pig genome.[126]\n","\n","\n","\n","Patents and commercialization\n","********************************************************************************\n","As of December 2014, patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies had been formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[127]\n","\n","As of November 2013 SAGE Labs had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and nonexclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[128]\n","\n","\n","\n","Society and culture\n","********************************************************************************\n","\n","\n","In light of plans or ongoing research to apply CRISPR to human embryos in at least four labs in the US, labs in China and the UK, and by a US biotechnology company called Ovascience,[129] scientists including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use. They said \"scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans\" until the full implications \"are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations\".[32][130] These scientists support basic research on CRISPR and do not see CRISPR as developed enough for any clinical use in making inheritable changes to people.[131]\n","\n","In April 2015, scientists from China published a paper in the journal Protein & Cell reporting results of an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder.[132][133] According to the paper's lead author, the study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns; the journals did not comment to reporters.[134] The experiments resulted in changing only some of the genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The scientists who conducted the research stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. One said to a reporter at Nature: \"If you want to do it in normal embryos, you need to be close to 100%.... Thatâs why we stopped. We still think itâs too immature.\"[134]\n","\n","In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of David Baltimore. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. In conclusion, they agreed to proceed further with basic and clinical research under appropriate legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between clinical use in somatic cells, where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes would be inherited by future generations. This could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. Social Darwinism), hence altering of gametocytes and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was claimed irresponsible. In addition, they agreed to initiate an international forum where these concerns will be continuously addressed, and regulations in research harmonised across countries.[135]\n","\n","In 2012 and 2013, CRISPR was a runner-up in Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the Year award.

In 2010, synthetic nucleases called transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the design and creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a much more difficult and time-consuming process than that of designing guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires synthesizing only a short RNA sequence, a procedure that is already widely used for many other molecular biology techniques (e.g. creating oligonucleotide primers).[12]\\nWhereas methods such as RNA interference (RNAi) do not fully suppress gene function, CRISPR, ZFNs, and TALENs provide full irreversible gene knockout.[13] CRISPR can also target several DNA sites simultaneously simply by introducing different gRNAs. In addition, the costs of employing CRISPR are relatively low.[13][14][15]\\n\\n\\nDiscovery\\n\\nIn 2012 Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published their finding that CRISPR-Cas9 could be programmed with RNA to edit genomic DNA, now considered one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology.[16]\\n\\n\\nPatents and commercialization\\n\\nAs of November\\xa02013[update], SAGE Labs (part of Horizon Discovery group) had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and non-exclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models.[17] By 2015[update], Thermo Fisher Scientific had licensed intellectual property from ToolGen to develop CRISPR reagent kits.[18]\\nAs of December\\xa02014[update], patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools.[19] As companies ramped up financing, doubts as to whether CRISPR could be quickly monetized were raised.[20] In February 2017 the US Patent Office ruled on a patent interference case brought by University of California with respect to patents issued to the Broad Institute, and found that the Broad patents, with claims covering the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, were distinct from the inventions claimed by University of California.[21][22][23]\\nShortly after, University of California filed an appeal of this ruling.[24][25]\\n\\n\\nRecent events\\n\\nIn March 2017, the European Patent Office (EPO) announced its intention to allow broad claims for editing all kinds of cells to Max-Planck Institute in Berlin, University of California, and University of Vienna,[26][27] and in August 2017, the EPO announced its intention to allow CRISPR claims in a patent application that MilliporeSigma had filed.[26] As of August\\xa02017[update] the patent situation in Europe was complex, with MilliporeSigma, ToolGen, Vilnius University, and Harvard contending for claims, along with University of California and Broad.[28]\\nIn July 2018, the ECJ ruled that gene editing for plants was a sub-category of GMO foods and therefore that the CRISPR technique would henceforth be regulated in the European Union by their rules and regulations for GMOs.[29]\\nIn February 2020, a US trial safely showed CRISPR gene editing on three cancer patients.[30]\\nIn October 2020, researchers Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in this field.

The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from Osaka University researcher Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the \"iap\" gene (isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase)[14] that was their target. The organization of the repeats was unusual. Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersed different sequences.[14][11] They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.\\nIn 1993, researchers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in that bacterium. They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened the direct repeats among different strains of M. tuberculosis[15] and used this property to design a typing method that was named spoligotyping, which is still in use today.[16][17]\\nFrancisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain studied repeats observed in the archaeal organisms of Haloferax and Haloarcula species, and their function. Mojica\\'s supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in Haloferax volcanii. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time; this was the first full characterization of CRISPR.[17][18] By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself. They identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family.[19] In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who were searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.[18][20] In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of Archaeoglobus fulgidus were transcribed into long RNA molecules that were subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.[21][22]\\n\\n\\nCRISPR-associated systems\\n\\nA major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen\\'s observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or cas genes. Four cas genes (cas 1â4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed helicase and nuclease motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.[23] In this publication the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.\\n\\n  Simplified diagram of a CRISPR locus. The three major components of a CRISPR locus are shown: cas genes, a leader sequence, and a repeat-spacer array. Repeats are shown as gray boxes and spacers are colored bars. The arrangement of the three components is not always as shown.[24][25] In addition, several CRISPRs with similar sequences can be present in a single genome, only one of which is associated with cas genes.[26]\\nIn 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids.[27][28][29] In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[24][30] All three studies proposing this idea were initially rejected by high-profile journals, but eventually appeared in other journals.[31]\\nThe first publication[28] proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by Mojica and collaborators at the University of Alicante, predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the RNA interference system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.[32]\\nExperimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published.[11][5] A CRISPR region in Streptococcus thermophilus acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of S. thermophilus to different types of phage by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the tested phages.[33][34] In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) that in E. coli cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules called CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex.[35] Moreover, it was found that Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus. By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of S. epidermidis targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent conjugation. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in Pyrococcus furiosus.[11][33] A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in S. thermophilus.[36]\\n\\n\\nCas9\\n\\nMain article: Cas9\\nResearchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes that relies on the protein Cas9. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small crRNA molecules and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).[37][38] Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a \"single-guide RNA\" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. This contribution was so significant that it was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage.[39] Another group of collaborators comprising Virginijus Å ikÅ¡nys together with GasiÅ«nas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the S. thermophilus CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA. These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.[17]\\nGroups led by Feng Zhang and George Church simultaneously published descriptions of genome editing in human cell cultures using CRISPR-Cas9 for the first time.[11][40][41] It has since been used in a wide range of organisms, including baker\\'s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae),[42][43][44] the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans,[45][46] zebrafish (Danio rerio),[47] fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster),[48][49] ants (Harpegnathos saltator[50] and Ooceraea biroi[51]), mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti[52]), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans),[53] plants,[54] mice,[55][56] monkeys[57] and human embryos.[58]\\nCRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allow scientists to target and activate or silence specific genes.[59]\\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system has shown to make effective gene edits in Human tripronuclear zygotes first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P. Liang and Y. Xu. The system made a successful cleavage of mutant Beta-Hemoglobin (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos. 4 out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template given by the scientists. The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template. DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.[60]\\n\\n\\nCas12a (formerly Cpf1)\\n\\nIn 2015, the nuclease Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1[61]) was characterized in the CRISPR/Cpf1 system of the bacterium Francisella novicida.[62][63] Its original name, from a TIGRFAMs protein family definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cas12a showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a \\'staggered\\' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the \\'blunt\\' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a \\'T rich\\' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA).\\nThese differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cas12a\\'s small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9\\'s sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5â² overhangs left by Cas12a can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.[64] Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18â23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cas12a enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations that destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.[65]\\n\\n\\nCas13 (formerly C2c2)\\n\\nIn 2016, the nuclease Cas13a (formerly known as C2c2) from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii was characterized. Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, which means that it does not cleave DNA, but only single-stranded RNA. Cas13 is guided by its crRNA to a ssRNA target and binds and cleaves the target. A distinctive feature of Cas13, as compared to Cas9, is that after cutting its target, Cas13 remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssRNA molecules non-discriminately. [66] This property is called \"collateral cleavage\" and has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.
